## Styling | Components
1. Styliing classes and utilities
- There are no CSS-style libraries used for this project. 
- Component-specific styles start with the component name itself i.e., *component-name*-random-class-name
- Utility classes have class names similar to TailwindCSS.

2. Components
- All visual parts of the app are located ./components
- Reusable components have their styles located in ./index.scss

## App Structure
- Assets: Holds images, fonts, and SVG icons used all through the app
- Components: All visual components of the app reside here â€” this includes all shared components, pages, and layouts.
- HTTP: An instance of Axios and an interceptor can be found in the *interceptor.ts*. A class for fetching users is found within this folder. This allows for cleaner components and confines data fetching to this component.
- Utils: Reusable code pieces are exported from here, these include, a date formatted, and the nav bar structure.
